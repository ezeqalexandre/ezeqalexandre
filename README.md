## 👋 About Me

My name is **Ezequiel Alexandre**, I hold a degree in **Business Administration** and I'm currently pursuing a second bachelor's in **Information Technology** at **UNIVESP**. I’m currently focused on **🐍 Python** and **📈 Project Management**, combining structured thinking, efficiency, and technology to solve real-world challenges.

I’m driven by a critical mindset and a constant pursuit of learning. Transitioning from a 10-year career in the public sector, I aim to apply my background in process optimization and strategic management to fields like **Cybersecurity** and **IT Project Delivery**.
